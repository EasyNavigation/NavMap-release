Small HTTP GET-to-file helper with retries, shared by geo/dem.py and geo/imagery.py.

DEM/imagery fetches are many sequential requests against third-party tile
servers (dozens to thousands per run); a single transient connection hiccup
on any one of them should not abort an otherwise-successful run, especially
since the disk cache means a bare re-run would otherwise have to re-fetch
nothing except that one tile anyway.

    GET `url` and stream it to `dest`, retrying transient failures.

    Retries on `requests.exceptions.RequestException` (connection errors,
    timeouts, etc.) with a short backoff; does not retry on HTTP error status
    codes (`raise_for_status()`) other than a 404 when `allow_404` is set.

    Returns `True` if the download succeeded (`dest` was created). Returns
    `False` without creating `dest` if `allow_404` is set and the server
    returned 404. Raises the last `RequestException` if every attempt fails.
