"""
Combine a DEM grid and an imagery mosaic into local-ENU samples.

Both --gazebo and --navmap consume the exact same `TerrainGrid` for a given
(center, size) query -- that shared source is *why* the two outputs line up
even when generated in separate invocations (see easynav_gis_tool.md).

Texture rendering is deliberately decoupled from `TerrainGrid`'s geometry
spacing (which follows the DEM's coarser ~30 m native resolution): the mesh
is coarse, but the draped texture can still use the imagery's much finer
native resolution, exactly like a game/robotics terrain that combines a
low-poly heightfield with a high-resolution diffuse texture.
