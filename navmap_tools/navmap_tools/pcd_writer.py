"""
ASCII PCD (x y z) writer and reader, plus a parallel per-point RGB sidecar.

The PCD itself matches the header shape of maps/*.pcd in
src/urjc-excavation-world (VERSION 0.7, FIELDS x y z, TYPE F F F, DATA ascii)
so the same `pointcloud_to_navmap` C++ tool that already works for that world
can also consume navmap_tools' output.

Colors are written as a *separate* same-row-order CSV rather than a packed
`rgb` PCD field: PCL's XYZRGB PCD field is a float that is actually a
bit-reinterpreted packed uint32, an easy thing to get subtly wrong from
Python without a byte-for-byte match to PCL's own (un)packing. A plain CSV of
"r,g,b" per line, read back in C++ as three ordinary uint8s, has no such
pitfall and is trivial to test on both ends.
